            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h5>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h5>
            <p>I like the focus on both technical and personal development and I think their values align well with my own. It's also clear the experience will be very different from any learning environment I have been part of before.</p>
            <h5>What are your impressions?</h5>
            <p>It's going to be tough and you will need to be completely commited if you want to succeed, but the more I take part in it the more sure I am I have made the right choice in signing up with EDA.</p>
            <h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5>
            <p>I attended an EDA day in the life session and one of the main reasons I ended up signing up to the bootcamp was the values they emphasised and the positive, supportive and collabaritive culture they tried to foster. I hope to embrace the culture, especially when it comes to reflection and collaboration as these are areas that I struggle in.</p>
            <h5>Have your expectations of EDA changed? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h5>
            <p>Shereef’s video and the first week of phase 0 have reinforced what I took out of the day in the life session and I am excited to jump into rest of the bootcamp. I am a bit nervous as well as this is a big step for me and I will definitely be out of my comfort zone?</p>

            <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
            <h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
            <p>I downloaded the headspace app and did the first meditation session.</p>
            <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
            <p>Several of the resources suggested working on a smaller scale. When I think about the times I have struggled to complete a project, I definitely focused too much on the final product or goal and ended up feeling overwhelmed or that I wasn't making enough progress.  </p>
            <h5>What worked for you?</h5>
            <p>I enjoyed the meditation. It's a bit early to say if it 'worked' but am planning on turning it into daily practice. The sprints also seem to be broken into smaller topics so hopefully I will feel like I am progressing as the bootcamp progresses.</p>
            <h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5>
            <p>I will keep going with meditation and would like to get into the habit of meditating every morning. I also want to try out timeboxing some of the tasks in the next sprint as I found I was spending too much time on the resource material during this first sprint.</p>
          </div>

            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <h5>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h5>
            <p>I have a background in neuroscience and reading through it I was a bit hesitant to take the scientific conclusions at face value as they often paint with a broad brush. Ultimately the importance of emotional intelligence is clear and I found the idea of training your emotional skills exciting. I don't think I have given this part of my personality enough thought and generally have just gone ahead with life as if they are innate and unchangeable.</p>
            <h5>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h5>
            <p>I have been using the Headspace app to do five minutes of mediation before bed every night for the last few days. I enjoy it but find it difficult to stay 'in the moment', my mind seems to wander constantly. Hopefully with more practice I will get closer to the strong, stable and perceptive attention the chapter talks about.</p>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <div id = "cBlogFour">
            <h2>Meditation Process</h2>
            <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
            <p>The hope was that I would focus more on understanding how the different elements on the website worked rather than having everything working perfectly. However, I found it difficult to finish off the sprint before I was happy with the final product and have spent much more time on the aesthetic than I expected to. Something to work on going forward.
            <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
            <p>As mentioned in the previous blog post, I have been doing a regular meditation practice since beggining the course. I have been doing it before bed and find it's useful to help me switch off at the end of the day.</p>
            <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
            <p>My mind wanders constantly when I am trying to meditate and I have been critical of myself when it happens. The chapter outlined how you should think of it as a chance to flex your attention 'muscle' and that it is a positive thing.</p>
            <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
            <p>I have mainly been focusing on my breathing during my practice as I am trying to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
          </div>

            <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2>
            <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
            <p>As someone who struggles to be the focus of attention or talk about myself in general, it was difficult to be the only person who was talking for what felt like a relatively long time. It helped that my wife was my conversation partner as I have done a similar exercise previously with someone who I did not know well and filled the time with several long silences. Reflecting on the exercise my partner found it easier to focus only on listening than she expected as in everyday life she finds herself getting distracted quickly and both of us were able to accurately relay what the other person had been speaking about.</p>
            <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
            <p>I have decided to get a meditation buddy and have weekly check-ins so that I have someone to keep me accountable. The other two techniques relied more on internal motivation and with the various things I have on my plate at the moment, sticking to a mediation practice when I have only myself to answer to has not gone well. It also appealed to me to try an expose someone else to something that might make a positive impact in their life.</p>

            <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
            <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
            <p>The chapter describes them as essentially the same thing - they both relate to your ability to pay attention to and examine yourself and the state/moment that you are in.</p>
            <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
            <p>I tried body scanning and while I don’t often fidget, as soon as I started to pay attention my body I immediately wanted move around and scratch various itches. More importantly my body was much more tense that I realised, especially around my neck and jaw. This did improve the more I paid attention to it and when I tried to ‘scan for an emotion’ by focusing on a positive memory.</p>
            <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
            <p>That I should learn to separate myself from the emotion I am experiencing. It’s commonsense that your emotions are always changing, but I do tend to get caught up and dwell in them.</p>
          </div>

            <h2>Control</h2>
            <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
            <p>In general, I tend to be even keeled in my everyday life and the same has been true for me when programming. My biggest trigger during course has been when I get blocked, especially if I can’t see where I have gone wrong and am not sure where to start looking for the solution. In the most recent case, I reacted in frustration and instead of thinking about what was happening I tried to bludgeon my way through using trial and error.
              <br>
              <br>
              While not specific to programming, I am triggered by the time constraints I have to complete the assignments and if I do end up working as a developer I will need to be better about this. I am sure there will always be time pressure involved!</p>
            <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
            <p>I found it difficult to work through the exercise as it involved focusing your attention on a negative experience, however I often needed to shift my attention away from this to refer back to the book. I also found it difficult to spend so long reflecting on the negative experience when that experience itself was quite brief. However, I can appreciate how the practice would be useful especially taking the time to examine a situation instead of just reacting.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
            <p>It resonated with me because I definitely have not spent enough time focusing on ‘purpose’, although taking the EDA course is a start. I am somewhat sceptical about how rosy they make life seem when your work is aligned with your purpose, I think people are not so easily contented but it is something I am striving towards.</p>
            <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</h5>
            <h5 class = "underline">What are your core values?</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Always adventure.</li>
              <li>Live life with integrity.</li>
              <li>Be open to new experiences.</li>
              <li>Be empathetic with all people.</li>
              <li>Make a positive impact on the world.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class = "underline">What do you stand for?</h5>
            <p>I want to empower people, because I believe that everyone should have the chance to live a happy and fulfilling life.</p>
            <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
            <p>I think of myself as a resilient person, although it’s not something I have previously thought about training further. I found the mediation exercises difficult to complete, not because of the emotions associated with the experiences but rather because I found it difficult to identify and focus on a specific emotion. For the failure experience, it felt much more diffuse and just general unpleasantness instead of discrete emotions. I also struggled with the success exercise as I don’t often feel comfortable with praising myself so there were some negative emotions associated with something that was meant to be focusing on a positive experience.</p>

            <h2>Connecting</h2>
            <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
            <p>I haven't had a chance to put the techniques into practice yet but feel like they mirror how I normally act.</p>
            <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
            <p>I did the exercise with my wife and we were both able to provide accurate feedback on how the other was feeling. A good sign for the marriage!</p>
            <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
            <p>The meditation practice went well and I plan on using it in place of my normal meditation a few times a week. I enjoyed focusing on positive thoughts and emotions as I often find my mind wandering to trivial or negative thoughts during my normal practice.</p>
            <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
            <p>Based on all of the exercises up to this point it feels like you need to be mindful of several things going into a conversation and then even more during the conversation itself. When I remember to do it, I find it difficult to split my attention during my everyday interactions and going forward I plan on focusing on one thing until it becomes a habit and hopefully happens unconsciously.</p>

            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>
            <p>For last few years I had a boss who was very compassionate, you always felt that she cared about you as a person and would look out for your best interests. I had a great deal of trust in her and as a result a good an open relationship.</p>
            <h5>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
            <p>I found it suprisingly difficlty to visualise myself breathing in the 'goodness' and was becoming frustrated during the initial part of the practice. Interestingly I found it much simpler to visualise others, even for the part where you visualise everyone in the world. I don't think I completed this task very successfully but it did reduce some of my last minute bootcamp prep anxiety. I will try it again because I would like to improve my visualisation skills.</p>
            <h5>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>
            <p>I have looked at the SCARF model before and had disregarded status as something that motivates me as I tend to be internally driven. However, the chapter outlines how you can frame it as status compared to your previous self and I now realise this is one of the more important motivators for me as I am focusing on improving my abilities as a developer. Autonomy has always been very important to me and as much of the bootcamp will involve pair or group work, I will need to ensure that I don't get frustrated by not being fully in control. Thinking about others motivation in terms of the SCARF model will also hopefully help to better build our relationships during the course.</p>
            <h5>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h5>
            <p>As someone who avoids confrontation, this is something that I need to work on. I worked through the difficult conversation exercise in Search Inside Yourself chapter eight and while I consider myself to be an empathetic person and able to recognise the 'feeling conversation', I realised that when it comes to the 'identity conversation' I have been focused too much on myself and not the other person invovled.</p>
