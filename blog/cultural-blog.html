            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h5>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h5>
            <p>I like the focus on both technical and personal development and I think their values align well with my own. It's also clear the experience will be very different from any learning environment I have been part of before.</p>
            <h5>What are your impressions?</h5>
            <p>It's going to be tough and you will need to be completely commited if you want to succeed, but the more I take part in it the more sure I am I have made the right choice in signing up with EDA.</p>
            <h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5>
            <p>I attended an EDA day in the life session and one of the main reasons I ended up signing up to the bootcamp was the values they emphasised and the positive, supportive and collabaritive culture they tried to foster. I hope to embrace the culture, especially when it comes to reflection and collaboration as these are areas that I struggle in.</p>
            <h5>Have your expectations of EDA changed? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h5>
            <p>Shereef’s video and the first week of phase 0 have reinforced what I took out of the day in the life session and I am excited to jump into rest of the bootcamp. I am a bit nervous as well as this is a big step for me and I will definitely be out of my comfort zone?</p>

            <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
            <h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
            <p>I downloaded the headspace app and did the first meditation session.</p>
            <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
            <p>Several of the resources suggested working on a smaller scale. When I think about the times I have struggled to complete a project, I definitely focused too much on the final product or goal and ended up feeling overwhelmed or that I wasn't making enough progress.  </p>
            <h5>What worked for you?</h5>
            <p>I enjoyed the meditation. It's a bit early to say if it 'worked' but am planning on turning it into daily practice. The sprints also seem to be broken into smaller topics so hopefully I will feel like I am progressing as the bootcamp progresses.</p>
            <h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5>
            <p>I will keep going with meditation and would like to get into the habit of meditating every morning. I also want to try out timeboxing some of the tasks in the next sprint as I found I was spending too much time on the resource material during this first sprint.</p>

            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <h5>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h5>
            <p>I have a background in neuroscience and reading through it I was a bit hesitant to take the scientific conclusions at face value as they often paint with a broad brush. Ultimately the importance of emotional intelligence is clear and I found the idea of training your emotional skills exciting. I don't think I have given this part of my personality enough thought and generally have just gone ahead with life as if they are innate and unchangeable.</p>
            <h5>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h5>
            <p>I have been using the Headspace app to do five minutes of mediation before bed every night for the last few days. I enjoy it but find it difficult to stay 'in the moment', my mind seems to wander constantly. Hopefully with more practice I will get closer to the strong, stable and perceptive attention the chapter talks about.</p>

            <h2>Meditation Process</h2>
            <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
            <p>The hope was that I would focus more on understanding how the different elements on the website worked rather than having everything working perfectly. However, I found it difficult to finish off the sprint before I was happy with the final product and have spent much more time on the aesthetic than I expected to. Something to work on going forward.
            <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
            <p>As mentioned in the previous blog post, I have been doing a regular meditation practice since beggining the course. I have been doing it before bed and find it's useful to help me switch off at the end of the day.</p>
            <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
            <p>My mind wanders constantly when I am trying to meditate and I have been critical of myself when it happens. The chapter outlined how you should think of it as a chance to flex your attention 'muscle' and that it is a positive thing.</p>
            <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
            <p>I have mainly been focusing on my breathing during my practice as I am trying to keep it as simple as possible.</p>

            <h2>Daily Mindfulness</h2>
            <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
            <p>As someone who struggles to be the focus of attention or talk about myself in general, it was difficult to be the only person who was talking for what felt like a relatively long time. It helped that my wife was my conversation partner as I have done a similar exercise previously with someone who I did not know well and filled the time with several long silences. Reflecting on the exercise my partner found it easier to focus only on listening than she expected as in everyday life she finds herself getting distracted quickly and both of us were able to accurately relay what the other person had been speaking about.</p>
            <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
            <p>I have decided to get a meditation buddy and have weekly check-ins so that I have someone to keep me accountable. The other two techniques relied more on internal motivation and with the various things I have on my plate at the moment, sticking to a mediation practice when I have only myself to answer to has not gone well. It also appealed to me to try an expose someone else to something that might make a positive impact in their life.</p>

            <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
            <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
            <p>The chapter describes them as essentially the same thing - they both relate to your ability to pay attention to and examine yourself and the state/moment that you are in.</p>
            <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
            <p>I tried body scanning and while I don’t often fidget, as soon as I started to pay attention my body I immediately wanted move around and scratch various itches. More importantly my body was much more tense that I realised, especially around my neck and jaw. This did improve the more I paid attention to it and when I tried to ‘scan for an emotion’ by focusing on a positive memory.</p>
            <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
            <p>That I should learn to separate myself from the emotion I am experiencing. It’s commonsense that your emotions are always changing, but I do tend to get caught up and dwell in them.</p>

            <h2>Control</h2>
            <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
            <p>In general, I tend to be even keeled in my everyday life and the same has been true for me when programming. My biggest trigger during course has been when I get blocked, especially if I can’t see where I have gone wrong and am not sure where to start looking for the solution. In the most recent case, I reacted in frustration and instead of thinking about what was happening I tried to bludgeon my way through using trial and error.
              <br>
              <br>
              While not specific to programming, I am triggered by the time constraints I have to complete the assignments and if I do end up working as a developer I will need to be better about this. I am sure there will always be time pressure involved!</p>
            <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
            <p>I found it difficult to work through the exercise as it involved focusing your attention on a negative experience, however I often needed to shift my attention away from this to refer back to the book. I also found it difficult to spend so long reflecting on the negative experience when that experience itself was quite brief. However, I can appreciate how the practice would be useful especially taking the time to examine a situation instead of just reacting.</p>
