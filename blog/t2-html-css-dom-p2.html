    <h1>Udacity Reflection Part 2</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>The layout of a webpage is divided into a series of columns and rows (a grid) and this allows you to size and arrange elements in an appealing and easy way.</p>
      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>There are a range of devices that will be used to view your webpage and these will have different screen sizes and use different web browsers. You need to design your webpage so that it will still be be readable and functional no matter how it is viewed and this involves the layout changing in response to the users device.</p>
      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Semantic structure is writing your HTML in a way that makes the content easier understand. For instance, using tags that provide meaning and context to the reader instead of more generic tags that will achieve the same outcome (e.g. header instead of div or p). Some initial reading indicates that it is important for SEO as well as ranking places different weights on content within different tags.</p>
      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
      <p>Google fonts seems very useful, in sprint 1 I was struggling a bit to find a good place for font options. Don't know why I didn't go to the obvious option (Google)!</p>
