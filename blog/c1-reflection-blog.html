<h1>Reflection</h1>
<h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
<p>I like the focus on both technical and personal development and I think their values align well with my own. It's also clear the experience will be very different from any learning environment I have been part of before.</p>
<h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
<p>It's going to be tough and you will need to be completely commited if you want to succeed, but the more I take part in it the more sure I am I have made the right choice in signing up with EDA.</p>
<h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
<p>I attended an EDA day in the life session and one of the main reasons I ended up signing up to the bootcamp was the values they emphasised and the positive, supportive and collabaritive culture they tried to foster. I hope to embrace the culture, especially when it comes to reflection and collaboration as these are areas that I struggle in.</p>
<h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h3>
<p>Shereefâ€™s video and the first week of phase 0 have reinforced what I took out of the day in the life session and I am excited to jump into rest of the bootcamp. I am a bit nervous as well as this is a big step for me and I will definitely be out of my comfort zone?</p>
