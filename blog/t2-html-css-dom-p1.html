      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>You can think of HTML as the skeleton of a body, it provides the basic structure for the website and has all of the content. CSS would then be the skin, hair, eye colour etc that sits over the top of the skeleton. It provides instructions on what different parts (elements) of the website looks like. The DOM is the way your web browser interprets the information provided by the HTML and CSS.</p>
      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>All of the different elements in a website are rectangular in shape (boxes), allowing you to easily alter the design and layout of a website by styling the different boxes or moving them around.</p>
      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>The box model describes the box that surrounds every HTML element. The acutal content of the element is in the middle and then is wrapped in several layers that define the space around the content. Directly outside of the content is padding, then border and lastly margin.</p>
