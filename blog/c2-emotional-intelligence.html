    <h1>Search Inside Yourself</h1>
    <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
    <p>I have a background in neuroscience and reading through it I was a bit hesitant to take the scientific conclusions at face value as they often paint with a broad brush. Ultimately the importance of emotional intelligence is clear and I found the idea of training your emotional skills exciting. I don't think I have given this part of my personality enough thought and generally have just gone ahead with life as if they are innate and unchangeable.</p>
    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>I have been using the Headspace app to do five minutes of mediation before bed every night for the last few days. I enjoy it but find it difficult to stay 'in the moment', my mind seems to wander constantly. Hopefully with more practice I will get closer to the strong, stable and perceptive attention the chapter talks about.</p>
