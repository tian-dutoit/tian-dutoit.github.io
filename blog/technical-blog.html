            <h5>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5>
            <p>You can think of HTML as the skeleton of a body, it provides the basic structure for the website and has all of the content. CSS would then be the skin, hair, eye colour etc that sits over the top of the skeleton. It provides instructions on what different parts (elements) of the website looks like. The DOM is the way your web browser interprets the information provided by the HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h5>What is meant by boxifying design?</h5>
            <p>All of the different elements in a website are rectangular in shape (boxes), allowing you to easily alter the design and layout of a website by styling the different boxes or moving them around.</p>
            <h5>What is the box model?</h5>
            <p>The box model describes the box that surrounds every HTML element. The acutal content of the element is in the middle and then is wrapped in several layers that define the space around the content. Directly outside of the content is padding, then border and lastly margin.</p>

            <h2>Udacity Reflection Part 2</h2>
            <h5>What is grid based design?</h5>
            <p>The layout of a webpage is divided into a series of columns and rows (a grid) and this allows you to size and arrange elements in an appealing and easy way.</p>
            <h5>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h5>
            <p>There are a range of devices that will be used to view your webpage and these will have different screen sizes and use different web browsers. You need to design your webpage so that it will still be be readable and functional no matter how it is viewed and this involves the layout changing in response to the users device.</p>
            <h5>What is semantic structure?</h5>
            <p>Semantic structure is writing your HTML in a way that makes the content easier understand. For instance, using tags that provide meaning and context to the reader instead of more generic tags that will achieve the same outcome (e.g. header instead of div or p). Some initial reading indicates that it is important for SEO as well as ranking places different weights on content within different tags.</p>
            <h5>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h5>
            <p>Google fonts seems very useful, in sprint 1 I was struggling a bit to find a good place for font options. Don't know why I didn't go to the obvious option (Google)!</p>

          <h2>Design to web</h2>
          <h5>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</h5>
          <p>A responsive site is a website designed to change it's layout based on the screen size being used to access it. Because of the wide range of devices being used to view websites you need to make sure that the information presented is clear and the website features are functional no matter the size of the screen being used to view it. You also need to account for the different ways people will interact with a website when using different devices, for instance mobile phones use touch screens which makes things like drop-down menus difficult to use.</p>
          <h5>What is mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h5>
          <p>When designing a responsive website it's useful to begin your planning with the mobile version as this will be the simplest version of your design due to the smaller screen size and technical limitations. It is easier to add things to your simpler mobile design than it is to try and make all of different elements in a full desktop website fit onto a mobile screen, or having to work out what elements you will need to lose or change so that it works on the smaller screen.</p>
          <h5>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</h5>
          <p>Frameworks are packages of prewritten code for common and useful elements or page structures, allowing you to easilly add items to your website without having to do all of the coding yourself. This way you are not constantly rewritting code every time you are working on a new project and means there is some consistency across different developers as they may otherwise solve problems using different code. This blog page used the Skeleton framework for the layout and responsive design as it already had a number of preset column widths that were based on the screensize. By using a framewok you do sacrifice some flexibility and by reusing someone else's code you aren't learning how to solve that particular problem on your own.</p>
          <h5>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h5>
          <p>A wireframe is a basic sketch of the layout of website. It should include all of the different elements that you want to include in the website but without the content and styling. This allows you to get a feel for what your website will look like before you actually begin to create it.</p>
          <h5>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h5>
          <p>I have had some trouble with rearranging the columns as the screen size changes. It seems to work properly when I change the size of my browser, however the layout doesn't change when I use the inspect element feature and toggle the device to mobile phone.</p>
