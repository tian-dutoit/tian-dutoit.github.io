    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>I downloaded the headspace app and did the first meditation session.</p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>Several of the resources suggested working on a smaller scale. When I think about the times I have struggled to complete a project, I definitely focused too much on the final product or goal and ended up feeling overwhelmed or that I wasn't making enough progress.  </p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed the meditation. It's a bit early to say if it 'worked' but am planning on turning it into daily practice. The sprints also seem to be broken into smaller topics so hopefully I will feel like I am progressing as the bootcamp progresses.</p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>I will keep going with meditation and would like to get into the habit of meditating every morning. I also want to try out timeboxing some of the tasks in the next sprint as I found I was spending too much time on the resource material during this first sprint</p>
