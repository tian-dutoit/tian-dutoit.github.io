            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
            <p>I like the focus on both technical and personal development and I think their values align well with my own. It's also clear the experience will be very different from any learning environment I have been part of before.</p>
            <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
            <p>It's going to be tough and you will need to be completely commited if you want to succeed, but the more I take part in it the more sure I am I have made the right choice in signing up with EDA.</p>
            <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
            <p>I attended an EDA day in the life session and one of the main reasons I ended up signing up to the bootcamp was the values they emphasised and the positive, supportive and collabaritive culture they tried to foster. I hope to embrace the culture, especially when it comes to reflection and collaboration as these are areas that I struggle in.</p>
            <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h3>
            <p>Shereefâ€™s video and the first week of phase 0 have reinforced what I took out of the day in the life session and I am excited to jump into rest of the bootcamp. I am a bit nervous as well as this is a big step for me and I will definitely be out of my comfort zone?</p>

            <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
            <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
            <p>I downloaded the headspace app and did the first meditation session.</p>
            <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
            <p>Several of the resources suggested working on a smaller scale. When I think about the times I have struggled to complete a project, I definitely focused too much on the final product or goal and ended up feeling overwhelmed or that I wasn't making enough progress.  </p>
            <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
            <p>I enjoyed the meditation. It's a bit early to say if it 'worked' but am planning on turning it into daily practice. The sprints also seem to be broken into smaller topics so hopefully I will feel like I am progressing as the bootcamp progresses.</p>
            <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
            <p>I will keep going with meditation and would like to get into the habit of meditating every morning. I also want to try out timeboxing some of the tasks in the next sprint as I found I was spending too much time on the resource material during this first sprint.</p>

            <h1>Search Inside Yourself</h1>
            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
            <p>I have a background in neuroscience and reading through it I was a bit hesitant to take the scientific conclusions at face value as they often paint with a broad brush. Ultimately the importance of emotional intelligence is clear and I found the idea of training your emotional skills exciting. I don't think I have given this part of my personality enough thought and generally have just gone ahead with life as if they are innate and unchangeable.</p>
            <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>I have been using the Headspace app to do five minutes of mediation before bed every night for the last few days. I enjoy it but find it difficult to stay 'in the moment', my mind seems to wander constantly. Hopefully with more practice I will get closer to the strong, stable and perceptive attention the chapter talks about.</p>
